I had a great experience at my first Hackathon a few weeks ago. It was organized by a company called [Place](www.place.com). There was free pizza and coffee. Also -- we won!

The prompt for the Hackathon was to integrate an LLM into a product. Our idea was to add semantic search to a real estate listings frontend. 

Once we gathered a sizeable dataset of properties, our approach was to embed the textual description of each listing, while keeping JSON fields as metadata around the vector. 

With this method we hoped to allow precise retrievals for quantitative attributes like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, min and max price etc. While for qualitative attributes, we could select vectors with the maximum [Cosine Similarity](https://) to the prompt from the reduced set of listings. 

We used techniques like prompt-chaining to generate richer, standardized query templates. We also used a long-term memory approach, ensuring that each user interaction carried over to subsequent ones.

As is typical with Hackathons, our project had many rough edges. Retrievals were limited by the richness of the description. Also, many features that would be desireable to capture, for example: wall color, school proximity, east facing window, simply were too subtle to be picked up on. 

We did have some ideas to improve the product, however, that were more involved. 

One was to run image-to-text models to extract descriptions from the 
multiple listing photos, then append these extractions to the existing listing description and embed the entire batch. This way we can get the "color of the wall paint." (There are some challenges with getting models to do this generally because of the lack of a subject in listing photos)

Another idea was to allow users to upload several images, and then have our system compare these in the embedded photo space against the gallery images. Essentially using images as the IR rather than natural language. Imagine someone who has Pinterest board with some aesthetic theme. That person could upload the board and search for the single most house that best matches the aesthetic.  

In the end, we had a solid presentation and tried to emphasize ideas further improvements. I think the latter was a great boost for us, since everyone is so excited about AI applications at the moment. Thanks to my team members for the great experience -- especially my friend Seif for getting me to sign up.
