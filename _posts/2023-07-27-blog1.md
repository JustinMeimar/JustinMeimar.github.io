This is my first post. I'm creating this blog simply to motivate a writting habbit. 

So, what am I up to on July 27th 2023?
- Reading [Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_My_Tears,_the_Policeman_Said) by PKD
- Dockerizing my Slack app for work  
- Ate a pizza for dinner

I was also playing around with [AI profile pictures](https://www.profilepicture.ai/) today. I wonder how digital personas will evolve in time.  

Every day, the future grows a little stranger and a lot more exciting.
