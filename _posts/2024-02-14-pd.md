Learning about the prisoners dillema, I suddenly found a way to characterize several social situations in my life. Here are a few that are my favourite.

1. Hockey Bench

When finishing a shift, the optimal viewing experience from the bench was to sit and watch play go by. Problem is, being able to both sit down and watch the game requires a prisoner's dilemma-esque cooperation among the team.

Every once in a while, a player will try to reason with his teammates, and convince everyone to sit down. "We can all watch the game comfortably!", he says. Suppose everyone cooperates, inevitably a player will stand up and a chain reaction begins. After one player defects and stands up to get a better view, the next player must also stand up to improve his view -- even though he is exhausted. Eventually, the last fella is practically hanging overboard because each player has to lean slightly further than the player before him.
