Learning about the prisoners dillema, I suddenly found a way to characterize several social situations in my life. Here are a few that are my favourite.

1. Hockey Bench

When finishing a shift, the optimal viewing experience from the bench was to sit and watch play go by. Problem is, being able to both sit down and watch the game requires a prisoners dillema esque cooperation among the team.

Every once and a while a player will try to reason with his teamates, and convince everyone to sit down. "We can all watch the game comfortably!", he says. Suppose everyone cooperates, innevitably a player will stand up and a chain reaction begins. After one player defects and stands up to get a better view, the next player must also stand up to improve his view -- even though he is exhausted.Eventuall the last fella is practically hanging overboard.
