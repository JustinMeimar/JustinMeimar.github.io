My homeserver has been exposed to the wild west internet for several months now.
Since I've been busy with school I haven't had a chance to monitor the logs too closely.

Now I'm long over due to these NGINX logs and see what sort of interesting stuff is laying around in the dirt.


```shell
âžœ  ~ siege -c 25 -r 40 https://justinmeimar.com/api/regex/aUbUdUeUfUgUeUhUeUfUd/b
** SIEGE 4.0.4
** Preparing 25 concurrent users for ba

Lifting the server siege...

```

Lets see how many unique IP addresses accessed my site.
Since each log contains the IP address as the first sequence of chars before being separated by a space, we can use this simple AWK script.

```
awk '{ print $1 }' /var/log/nginx/<log_file> | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
```
